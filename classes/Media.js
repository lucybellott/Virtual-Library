// totalMediaCount: A static property that tracks how many Media items have been created
// summary(): a method that returns a summary of the media (string) as "Title: <TITTLE>, Year: <YEAR>, Genre: <GENRE>"
// Export the Media class using module.exports.
// In index.js, import Media using require.



class Media {

 static totalMediaCount = 0;
    
   constructor(title, year, genre){
        this.title = title
        this.year = year
        this.genre = genre
        Media.totalMediaCount++
    }
   

    summary(){
        return `Title: ${this.title}, Year: ${this.year}, Genre: ${this.genre}`
    }
    
}


module.exports = Media;
